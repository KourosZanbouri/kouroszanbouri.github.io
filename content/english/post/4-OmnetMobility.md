As anyone who works with network simulators knows, a significant amount of time is spent on setup and configuration before you can even get to the interesting part—running the simulation itself. Recently, while working on a project with **Simu5G**, the 5G network simulator built on OMNeT++, I hit a familiar, tedious roadblock: positioning a large number of User Equipments (UEs).

## The Problem: A Sea of Coordinates

My goal was to simulate various scenarios with dozens, sometimes hundreds, of UEs interacting with a central gNodeB (the 5G base station). I needed them placed in specific patterns—sometimes static, sometimes mobile, often within a certain distance ring. The only way to do this out of the box was to manually calculate and write the `initialX` and `initialY` coordinates for every single UE in the `omnetpp.ini` file.

Doing this for 10 UEs is annoying. Doing it for 100 is a mind-numbing waste of time. I knew there had to be a better way. I wanted to focus on analyzing simulation results, not on being a human coordinate-entry machine. That's why I decided to build a simple tool to automate the entire process.

## The Solution: A Streamlit Web App 

I created the **OMNeT++ UE Position Generator**, a simple web application using Python's **Streamlit** library. My goal was to build something visual, interactive, and fast that could generate the exact `.ini` configuration I needed with just a few clicks.



Here’s what it does:

* **Interactive Controls**: A clean sidebar allows you to set all the key parameters: the gNB's coordinates, the total number of UEs, and the placement rules.
* **Flexible Placement**: You can choose between a **Static** deployment, where UEs are placed in a ring and don't move, or a **Mobility** deployment.
* **Mobility Models**: For mobile scenarios, you can select from common models like **Linear Mobility** (where UEs move in a straight line) or **Random Waypoint** (where they move randomly within a defined area).
* **Instant Visualization**: The app generates a 2D plot of the deployment, so you can see exactly where your gNB and UEs are. For linear mobility, it even draws arrows to show the UEs' initial direction of travel!
* **Code Generation**: The most important part! It produces a clean block of `.ini` configuration text that you can directly copy and paste into your OMNeT++ project.

## How It Works

The app is surprisingly simple under the hood. It uses `numpy` to handle the math, `matplotlib` to generate the plots, and of course, `streamlit` magically turns the whole Python script into an interactive web app.

### The Geometry of Placement

The core of the placement logic is based on simple geometry. To place a UE, the script doesn't think in terms of `X` and `Y` at first. Instead, it uses **polar coordinates**:
1.  It picks a random **distance** from the gNB (within the min/max you set).
2.  It picks a random **angle** (from 0 to 360 degrees).

With a distance and an angle, it then uses trigonometry (`cosine` and `sine`) to convert these polar coordinates into the final Cartesian (`X`, `Y`) coordinates for the `.ini` file.

The relationship between two points is defined by the Euclidean distance formula:

{{< math >}}
D = \\sqrt{(X_{UE} - X_{gNB})^2 + (Y_{UE} - Y_{gNB})^2}
{{< /math >}}

Where:
* $D$ is the distance between the UE and the gNB.
* $(X_{UE}, Y_{UE})$ are the coordinates of the User Equipment.
* $(X_{gNB}, Y_{gNB})$ are the coordinates of the gNodeB.

My tool simply works this logic in reverse to guarantee UEs are placed exactly where they need to be.

## Future Plans & Other Mobility Models

The tool currently supports three basic but very common scenarios. However, the INET framework for OMNeT++ is incredibly powerful and offers many more sophisticated mobility models that could be implemented. I may add these in the future, but I also wanted to share some references for anyone interested in exploring them further.

Some interesting models include:

* **GaussMarkovMobility**: A model where the speed and direction of a node change over time based on a Gauss-Markov stochastic process. It's great for creating more realistic, less predictable movement patterns.
* **MassMobility**: Simulates a scenario where a large group of nodes moves together towards a common destination, like a crowd moving at a concert.
* **CircleMobility**: A simple model where nodes move in a circular pattern around a central point.
* **TurtleMobility**: Allows you to define movement using a LOGO-style script with commands like "forward," "turn," etc.

You can find detailed documentation on these and many others in the official **[INET Framework Mobility Documentation](https://inet.omnetpp.org/docs/users-guide/ch-mobility.html)**.

This project started as a personal tool to solve a frustrating problem, but I hope it can be useful to other researchers in the OMNeT++ and Simu5G community.
